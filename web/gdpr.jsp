            <p><strong>M. Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is
                sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the
                server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or
                “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set
                expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire
                at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information
                that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the
                information stored in and obtained from cookies. {SELECT ACCURATE PHRASING We use only session cookies / only
